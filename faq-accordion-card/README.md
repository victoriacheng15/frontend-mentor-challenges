# FAQ accordion card solution

The challenge is to build out this [FAQ accordion card challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:

- To improve my `CSS` and `JavaScript` skill
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
