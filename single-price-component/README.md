# Single price grid component solution

The challenge is to build out this [Single price grid component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:

- To improve `Tailwind CSS` skill and learn about `@apply`
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action
