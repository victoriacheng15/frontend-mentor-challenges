# Tip calculator app solution

The challenge is to build out this [Tip calculator app challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:
- To improve `CSS` skill
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
