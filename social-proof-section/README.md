# Social proof section solution

The challenge is to build out this [Social proof section challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:
- To improve `CSS` skill
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
