# NFT preview card component solution

The challenge is to build out this [NFT preview card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:
- To learn about `Tailwind CSS`
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
