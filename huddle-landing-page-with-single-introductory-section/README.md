# Huddle landing page with single introductory section solution

The challenge is to build out this [Huddle landing page with single introductory section challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:

- To improve my `SCSS` skill
- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
