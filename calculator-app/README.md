## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile first approach

### What I learned

I learned couple things from this project and the article by Zell Liew (see link in Acknowledgements). `Firstly`, I utilized :root in CSS and this allows me to use the same variable names store all color values. `Secondly`, I tried to utilize named function for add or remove classes for color mode. This is to avoid type the same line over and over. `Lastly`, I learned that I can store values with dataset attribute and show them in inline style in HTML. This way, I can inspect values and logic with developer tool.

`Note: I feel the code is not pretty with this project. As I am improving my understanding on JavaScript, I may revisit and make an improved version in the future.`
