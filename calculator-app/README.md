# Calculator app solution

The challenge is to build out this [Calculator app challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:

- To improve `CSS` and `JavaScript` skills
- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
