# Interactive pricing component solution

The challenge is to build out this [interatice price component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:
- To imrpove my `SCSS` and `JavaScript` skills
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers
