# Sunnyside agency landing page solution

The challenge is to build out this [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Clickable hamburger menu
