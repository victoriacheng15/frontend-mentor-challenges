# Time tracking dashboard solution

The challenge is to build out this [Time tracking dashboard challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:

- To continue learning about `Tailwind CSS` and improve `JavaScript` skills
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
